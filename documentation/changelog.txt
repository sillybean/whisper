0.3 (Stephanie Leary)
-------
12/1/07
Recreated manual file and moved it into the control panel for portability.
Fixed bugs with apostrophes in page titles.
New feature: visibility. Unlike show/hide, which merely asks for a password
	to show hidden pages, invisible pages will not be listed at all outside
	the control panel. In other words, a hidden page is password-protected;
	an invisible page is not published.
Control panel updates:
	Changed control panel styles (to be quieter); rearranged panels.
	Added subsection title.
	Fixed form and table markup across all control panels; made tables' 
		appearance consistent.
	Changed charset to UTF-8 throughout.
	Fixed Textile reference link on editing panel.
	Added editing panel options for included plugins: drop-down for parent 
		page, checkboxes for show/hide and visibility.
Plugin changes:
	Sections -- Added <!reverse_sections> tag to serve as rudimentary 
		blog/news function. 
	Textile and Markdown -- updated to latest versions.
	File Manager -- ./uploads is now default starting point, and a warning 
		is displayed when you navigate up to the Whisper root.
	All -- made tables' appearance consistent.
New plugins:
	Quote -- displays a random quote from a list.
	Search -- provides a search function, available in both control panel 
		and public pages. New tags: <!search_form> and <!search_results>.
Added configuration option to show full page database rather than list on main 
	control panel. 	Added option to limit the list. If more pages exist, a 
	link to the page database will be appended to the list. (e.g. Page One, 
	Page Two ... see all pages) The default is 15. 
Fixed grammatical errors in interface and documentation.
Updated documentation.

Below is the changelog that came with Whisper 0.2 serial 1038:

Whisper Change Log (ZachOfAllTrades)

TO DO
-------
--clone content or template files
--replace all English phrases with calls to a getText library, to facilitate 
translation of the interface into other languages.
--plugin API for creating pref files

--The File Manager plugin is broken -- I need to straighten out
some path variables.

--The Layout Browser will have to be modified slightly, or
perhaps totally rethought.

I have not put together upgrade instructions -- because this is
not a "release". This is just me making available the updates
that I've made, so that other people can consider them.

FUNCTIONAL: Preference options to modify how control panel is displayed: the 
template management and page database panel widgets can be presented in the 
main control panel or as separate screens (separate preference setting for each).

6/2/04

FUNCTIONAL: Display list of all available search and replace tags (core + plugin) 
on edit screen when editing pages or templates

FUNCTIONAL: Hidden Page feature enhancement -- if visitor is directed to login 
page when requesting a hidden page, they will be forwarded to the page upon 
successful login, rather than arriving at the control panel.

5/31/04
BUG FIXES!
FUNCTIONAL: added preference variable that allows you to forward to the default 
generated page rather than render the default page. This allows for php to be 
executed on the default page (otherwise it will not execute when site visitor 
goes to teh whisper directory without specifying a file name).

FUNCTIONAL: template management -- add / edit / delete + any page can use any template

FUNCTIONAL: rebuild database by scanning content directory


5/28/04
CODE: more bug fixes on things that I've broken

FUNCTIONAL: added 'template' field to database so that each page can use any 
template. This extends the idea of a separate template for the "front" page, so 
that now any page can have it's own template, or all pages can have the same 
template, or a group of pages can have one template while another group of pages 
has a different one.
   default - output will be generated from the default template
   none - output is generated based purely on what is put into the edit window_
   * - output is generated from an template specified

FUNCTIONAL: added ability to create new templates

SECURITY: modified edit screen so that it will ONLY edit files in one of the 
three appropriate subdirectories

SECURITY: whisper will load/edit files from the three writable directories 
(configuration, content, layout) even if these files are completely blocked 
(password protected) from access thorugh web browsers. This works becasue when 
the script runs, it is not accessing files through http -- it is accessing files 
through the local file system.

-------
Documentation of code!

SECURITY/FUNCTIONAL: added preference variable for file generation path


5/27/04
--------
FUNCTIONAL:bug fixes on things that have been broken

SECURITY: added support (optional) to load username and password fields from a 
file that is stored outside of the web root

SECURITY: path to preference file and database file can no loger be modified in 
the "settings" window. They are set in a configuration section within the 
script.


5/26/04
--------
FUNCTIONAL: renamed config to "preferences" to note the difference between 
application "configuration" (settings that control how application works), and 
"preferences" (which are arbitrary and should be allowed to be changed at the 
user's whim)

SECURITY: added .htaccess to prevent directory listings on Apache webservers

SECURITY/FUNCTIONAL: created directory structure that will make additional 
security measures possible:

/.htaccess
/index.php
/whisper.css
/configuration/preferences.php
/configuration/whisperDB
/content/*
/layout/default.tmpl
/layout/none.tmpl
/layout/*.tmpl
/plugins/*

-Now the web root (or whatever the location of index.php is), no longer has to 
be a world-writable directory! (unless you want to use file generation in the 
same directory as the script)


5/25/04
---------
FUNCTIONAL: incorporated database table edit into main control panel
-introduced function get_pageTable() as means of making modular control 
structures

CODE: bug fix a bunch of out of scope variables

CODE: more breaking down into discrete functions


5/24/04
---------
FUNCTIONAL: moved control panel cookie crumb links to top of panel (from bottom 
of edit screens)
-this reduces number of times to generate same verbiage and link
-also keeps links in same position "above the fold" on every screen

CODE/SECURITY: removed parameter passing from authenticate()
-this increases security by preventing authenticated modules from faking the 
global password
-it also cleans up function calls

CODE: separated IF THEN flow control of script into a single switch clause, with 
calls to discrete functions for displaying different control panel screens
-had to change a lot of variable references to get past broken scope (made 
extensive use of $GLOBALS['__']
